# BullCowGame

Hello, everyone.

This game is part of the Unreal Programming Course in C++ on udemy.

It is called Bull Cow Game. It is a text based game that gets you to guess a word that is an isogram. You have 10 tries to guess the word, If you do not get the word in 10 tries given, you can replay until you get the word. All the code is here so any programmers can inspect my code and tell me if it's good or not.

All you need to start the game is to install Visual Studio Community Edition 2017 on PC, or Xcode on mac.

If you have a PC, all that is required to install it is to download the program onto computer. When the installer opens, make sure you select Game Development in C++ and on the pane that appears on the right, also select Windows 8 SDK.

If you do not want to start development, selecting Desktop Environment for C++ is sufficient.

On Mac, installing Xcode will give you an environment for C++.
